# Raspberry Pi Pico Projects
# Overview
This repository contains various projects developed using the Raspberry Pi Pico board and programmed with the Thonny IDE. These projects aim to explore different aspects of embedded systems, sensor integration, and IoT applications.

Each project demonstrates a unique use case, showcasing the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico in handling various sensors, actuators, and communication modules.
# Prerequisites
Raspberry Pi Pico
Thonny IDE
Sensors and Modules as per the project requirements (listed in each project folder).
Git (for cloning the repository and version control)
# How to Run the Projects
Clone the repository using the command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/harikrishnan178/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Project
Open the Thonny IDE and load the Python files from the respective project folder.

Ensure the necessary sensors/modules are connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico as per the project instructions.

Upload the code to the Raspberry Pi Pico by pressing the "Run" button in Thonny.

Monitor the output in the Thonny shell or as specified in the project documentation.

# Future Enhancements
Expand the range of sensors and modules integrated with Raspberry Pi Pico.
Implement more machine learning models for on-device AI processing with TinyML.
Add real-time monitoring using IoT platforms like Blynk or ThingSpeak.
